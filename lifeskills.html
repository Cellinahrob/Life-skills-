	<h3><em>Women being treated as property and positive aspects of marriage and motherhood</em> </h3>
	<p><strong>Women were married during their tender age.</strong>
	They are forced into marriages they never wished to be in.Instance of Effia who wanted to marry to Abeeku Badu but because of the greedy of her step mother  she let her go with James collins,the british governor.

	<p><strong>Women  were not assertive.</strong>The women  couldn't speak their mind they believed and accepted all men wanted.Instance where Bigman forced Maame to beat Abronoma or he will do it himself wich was something Maame would have told Big man it isn't agood idea.
	They  were mistreated by  male Men commanded authority and they beat their women.When Baaba beat Effia which was not good he should  have told Baaba like udults instead of the drama of beating her and Effia got everything.
<p><strong>It was a male dominated society.</strong>We have no instance of where a woman ruling.It is illustrated that the people ruling was Abeeku's father and Abeeku took over. </p>

<p><strong>Sexual Violation in women was an issue</strong> we see Essi was sexually violeted after she was enslaved and taken to the castle by the solder.<img src="https://www.radford.edu/gmartin/Ghana%207.jpg"> </p>
<p><strong>Women were not allowed to know men plans and what they do.</strong>Effia asked what Fiifi was going todo with the Knife but no one wanted her to know alot .</p>
<h4><strong>Treatment and role of women in the society today.</strong></h4>

<p><h5><em>Women who have accomplishments.</em></h5></p>

<p><strong>Today's society a woman  will married at her own set time.</strong>Maybe after building he carrier or after getting a job.For instance we have women who are maried in  30s some are financially stable they don't have to depend much on a man.</p>
<p><strong>Current women can speak their mind,</strong> can stand infront of men and  say what they think and it is done.We have good number of  women in prominent positions.We have women who fight for other women's right.
Life today we don't have,male dominated society because we also have women in leadership. 
<p><strong>No women slavery </strong>In today's life no woman is treated as a slave there human rights .</p>
<P><strong>Women can disscuss  issues with men dispite age and gender.</strong></P>
<p><strong>Sex violation is a crime.</strong>.So many women try to support other women and educating  them on sex related issues and how to go about sex violence. </p>
